                        <h2>hi. <br> 
                            <p>i am chris.</p>
                            <p>i am traveling the world with my guitar and my camera to pursue my passion for music, photography, boardsports and adventure. music plays the most important role in my life. </p>
                             <p>in 2016 i spent a couple of months in byron bay, australia and started singing and writing music.</p>
                            <p>i just recorded my first album ‘volcano’ on my 3/4 scale travel guitar at hive studios in byron bay and it will be released in july 2016. </p>
                            <p>i grew up in canada and germany and finished my masters degree in business and media management. during the past years i have been working as a key account manager, sound engineer, deejay, event manager and as a kitesurf instructor.</p></h2>


                        <h4>the story about my first album ‘volcano’</h4>

                        <h2><p>in 2015 two of my friends and i were hiking up a volcano on the island of lombok, indonesia. </p>
                        <p>we pitched our camp at the crater lake and during the night at 2 am the volcano started to erupt again after many years of being quite. i felt the eruption, woke up, took a look out of my tent and could not believe what i saw.</p>
                        <p> i spent a few hours watching the eruption and took a picture of probably the most powerful, magical and beautiful event i have ever seen. one of my songs ‘volcano’s heart’ is about this experience.</p> 
                        <p>this is the picture i am talking about:</p></h2>

                        <p>felix hawelka. one of the best mates from berlin that i have ever met. we have been running a business together, hosted epic parties and played lots of back-to-back dj sets. felix is my freeride buddy in winter times and we had great adventures in the mountains.</p>
